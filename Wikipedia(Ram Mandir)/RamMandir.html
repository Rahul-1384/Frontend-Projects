                <h2 id="rammandir">Ram Mandir</h2>
               <p>The Ram Mandir is a Hindu temple that is under construction in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the hypothesized birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.[6][7] The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid which was built after the demolition an existing non-Islamic structure.[8] The worship of Hindu god Ram and Sita at the disputed site started when their idols were installed in 1949.[9] In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered an unanimous verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for a temple of Ram, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque.[10] The court referenced a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was deemed to be non-Islamic.</p>
               <p>The foundation stone laying ceremony for the commencement of the construction of Ram Mandir was performed on 5 August 2020, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[12] The temple, currently under construction, is being supervised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. The inauguration of the temple, is scheduled for 22 January 2024.</p>
               <p>The temple has attracted a number of controversies due to its alleged misuse of donation, sidelining of its major activists and politicisation of the temple by the BJP.</p>
               
               <h2 id="history">History</h2>
               <h3 id="ancient"><b>Ancient and Medieval</b></h3>
               <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama">Rama</a>, an incarnation of Vishnu, is a Hindu deity. According to the ancient Indian epic, Ramayana, Rama was born in Ayodhya.</p>
               <p>In the 16th century, the temple was attacked and destroyed by Babur in his series of temple raids across northern India.[19] Later, the Mughals constructed a mosque, the Babri Masjid, which is believed to be the site of the Ram Janmabhoomi, the birthplace of Rama.[20] The earliest record of the mosque may be traced back to 1767, in the Latin book "Descriptio Indiae," authored by the Jesuit missionary, Joseph Tiefenthaler. According to him, the mosque was constructed by destroying the Ramkot temple, believed to be the fortress of Rama in Ayodhya, and the Bedi, where the birthplace of Rama is situated.</p>
               <p>The first instance of religious violence was documented in 1853.[22] In December 1858, the British administration prohibited Hindus from conducting puja (transl. rituals) at the contested site. A platform was created for conducting rituals outside the mosque.</p>

               <h3 id="modern"><b>Modern</b></h3>
               <p>The murtis (transl. idols) of Rama and Sita were installed inside the Babri Masjid on the night of 22–23 December 1949 and the devotees begin to gather from the next day.[24][9] By 1950, the state took control of the mosque under section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus, not Muslims, to perform their worship at the site.</p>
               <p>In the 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), belonging to the Hindu nationalist family, Sangh Parivar, launched a new movement to reclaim the site for Hindus and to erect a temple dedicated to the infant Rama (Ram Lalla) at this spot. The VHP began to collect funds and bricks with "Jai Shri Ram" written on them. Later, the government under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi gave the VHP permission for Shilanyas (transl. the foundation stone ceremony) to proceed, with the then Home Minister, Buta Singh, formally conveying the permission to the VHP leader, Ashok Singhal. Initially, the Government of India and Government of Uttar Pradesh had agreed that the shilanya would be conducted outside of the disputed site. However, on 9 November 1989, a group of VHP leaders and Sadhus laid the foundation stone by digging a 200-litre (7-cubic-foot) pit adjacent to the disputed land. The singhdwar (transl. main entrance) of the sanctum sanctorum was constructed there.[26] The VHP then laid the foundations of a temple on the land adjacent to the disputed mosque. On 6 December 1992, the VHP and the Bharatiya Janata Party organised a rally at the site involving 150,000 volunteers, known as karsevaks. The rally turned violent, the crowd overwhelmed the security forces and tore down the mosque.</p>
               <p>The demolition of the mosque resulted in several months of inter-communal violence between India's Hindu and Muslim communities, causing the death of an estimated 2,000 people in Bombay (now Mumbai) as a direct consequence, and triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent.[29] A day after the demolition of the mosque, on 7 December 1992, The New York Times reported that over 30 Hindu temples across Pakistan were attacked, some set on fire, and one was demolished. Hindu temples in Bangladesh were also attacked.</p>
               <p>On 5 July 2005, five terrorists attacked the makeshift Ram temple at the site of the destroyed Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. All five were shot dead in the ensuing encounter with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), while one civilian died in the grenade attack that the attackers launched to breach the cordoned wall. The CRPF suffered three casualties, two of whom were seriously injured with multiple gunshot wounds.</p>
               <p>Two archaeological excavations in 1978 and 2003 conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) found evidence indicating that the Hindu temple's remains existed on the site.[32][33] Archaeologist K. K. Muhammed accused several left-leaning historians of undermining the findings.[34] Over the years, various title and legal disputes took place, such as the passage of the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act in 1993. It was only after the Supreme Court's verdict on the Ayodhya dispute in 2019, that it was decided that the disputed land would be handed over to a trust formed by the Government of India for the construction of a Ram temple. The trust was eventually formed under the name of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra. On 5 February 2020, it was announced in the Parliament of India that the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi had accepted a plan to construct the temple. Two days later, on 7 February, five acres of land were allocated for a new mosque to be built 22 km (14 mi) away from Ayodhya in Dhannipur village.</p>

               <h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
               <p>The original design for Ram Mandir was devised in 1988 by the Sompura family of Ahmedabad.[2] The Sompuras have contributed to the design of over 100 temples worldwide for at least 15 generations, including the Somnath temple.[37] The chief architect of the temple was Chandrakant Sompura, assisted by his two sons, Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura, who are also architects.</p>
               <p>A new design, with some changes from the original, was prepared by the Sompuras in 2020,[38] per the Hindu texts, the Vastu shastra and the Shilpa shastras.[39] The temple will be 235 feet (72 m) wide, 360 feet (110 m) long and 161 feet (49 m) high. Once complete, the temple complex will be the world's third largest Hindu temple.[38] It is designed in the Gurjara-Chaulukya style of Nagara style architecture, a type of Hindu temple architecture found primarily in northern India.[37] A model of the proposed temple was showcased during the Prayag Kumbh Mela in 2019.</p>
               <p>The temple's main structure will be built on a raised platform with three storeys. It will have five mandapas in the middle of the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) and on the entrance passage. Three mandapas on one side shall be of Kudu, Nritya and Rang, and the two mandapas on the other side will be of Kirtan and Prarthana. In Nagara style, the mandapas are to be decorated with shikhara.</p>
               <p>The building will have a total of 366 columns. The columns will have 16 idols each to include the incarnations of Shiva, the 10 Dashavataras, the 64 Chausath Yoginis, and the 12 incarnations of the goddess Saraswati. The width of the stairs will be 16 feet (4.9 m). Per scriptures dedicated to the design of temples dedicated to Vishnu, the sanctum sanctorum will be octagonal.[39] The temple will be built in 10 acres (0.040 km2), and 57 acres (0.23 km2) of land will be developed into a complex with a prayer hall, a lecture hall, an educational facility and other facilities including a museum and a cafeteria.[26] According to the temple committee, over 70,000 people will be able to visit the site.[43] Larsen & Toubro offered to oversee the design and construction of the temple free of cost, and became the contractor of the project.[44][45] The Central Building Research Institute, National Geophysical Research Institute and the Bombay, Guwahati and Madras IITs are assisting in areas such as soil testing, concrete and design.</p>
               <p>The construction work will be accomplished with 600,000 cu ft (17,000 m3) of sandstone from Baansi in Rajasthan.[39] There will be no use of iron in the construction of the temple, and the fusing of the stone blocks will require ten thousand copper plates.[48] In a culturally significant move, Thailand is also symbolically contributing to the inauguration of the Ram Mandir, by sending soil to the Ram Janmabhoomi, building on their prior gesture of sending water from two rivers in Thailand to honour the temple.</p>

               <h3 id="deity">Deity</h3>
               <p>Ram Lalla Virajman, the infant form of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, is the presiding deity of the temple.[50] Ram Lalla's dress was stitched by tailors Bhagwat Prasad and Shankar Lal, a fourth generation tailor to Rama's idol.[51] Ram Lalla was a litigant in the court case over the disputed site in 1989, being considered a "juristic person" by the law.[2] He was represented by Triloki Nath Pandey, a senior VHP leader who was considered Ram Lalla's closest 'human' friend.</p>
               <p>According to the temple trust, the final blueprint includes temples dedicated to Surya, Ganesha, Shiva, Durga, Vishnu and Brahma in the temple grounds.[52] Two idols of Ram Lalla (one of them being 5 years old) will be placed in the sanctum of the temple.</p>

               <h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
               <p>The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust began the first phase of construction of the Ram Mandir in March 2020.[53][54] The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India caused a temporary suspension of the construction.[55][56] On 25 March 2020, Ram's idol was moved to a temporary location in the presence of the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath.[57] In preparation for the temple's construction, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) organised a 'Vijay Mahamantra Jaap Anushthan', in which individuals would gather at different places to chant the 'Vijay Mahamantra' – Shri Ram, Jai Ram, Jai Jai Ram, on 6 April 2020. This was said to ensure "victory over hurdles" in constructing the temple.</p>
               <p>It has been officially announced that 22 January 2024 is the scheduled date for the installation of the Lord Ram idol in the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) by Champat Rai, the General Secretary of the Sri Ram Janmbhoomi Kshetra Trust. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on 25 October 2023, was extended a formal invitation to attend the ceremony.</p>

               <h3 id="bhoomi">Bhoomi Poojan ceremony</h3>
               <p>The temple construction officially started again after a Bhoomi Poojan or groundbreaking ceremony on 5 August 2020. The three-day long Vedic ritual was held ahead of the groundbreaking ceremony, which revolved around the installation of a 40 kg (88 pounds) silver brick as the foundation stone by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[2] On the day before on 4 August, the Ramarchan Puja (transl. Puja of Shri Ram's feet) was performed, in order to invite all the major deities into the temple.</p>
               <p>On the occasion of the Bhoomi Poojan, soil and holy water were collected from several religious places across India, such as the Triveni Sangam of the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati at Prayagraj, as well as the Kaveri river in its orgin at Talakaveri in Karnataka and the Kamakhya Temple in Assam.[61][62][63] Soil was also sent from various Hindu temples, Gurudwaras and Jain temples across the nation, as well as from the four pilgrimage locations of Char Dham, to bless the temple.</p>
               <p>On 5 August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered prayers at the Hanuman Garhi Temple in Ayodhya to seek blessings of Lord Hanuman for the day's events.[67][68] The groundbreaking ceremony of Ram Mandir took place following this.[67] The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, Chief of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Mohan Bhagwat, Chief of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas and Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, Nritya Gopal Das and PM Narendra Modi gave speeches.</p>
               <h4>Reactions</h4>
               <p>Some priests and religious leaders complained that the ceremony did not follow proper ritual procedures. They also stated that the 5 August was not a ritually auspicious date and that the function did not include a havan.[71] In this respect, writer and activist Arundhati Roy, a noted critic of PM Modi, pointed out that the chosen date marked one year since the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.[72][29] Pakistan made an official statement through its foreign office criticising India for commencing construction of the temple, due to the history of the site.[73] On the contrary, various Indian political leaders praised the groundbreaking ceremony.</p>

               <h3 id="present">2021–present</h3>
               <p>In August 2021, a viewing location was created for the public to observe the construction works in the temple site.[75] Following the groundbreaking ceremony, up to 40 feet (12 m) of debris were removed and the remaining earth compacted.[76] The foundation was made using roller-compacted concrete.[77] A total of 47-48 layers, each layer one foot high, were completed by mid-September 2021.[76][78] Due to electricity supply issues in Mirzapur, the cutting of the sandstone was slowed down.[52] In the beginning of 2022, a video was released by the temple trust, showing the planned construction of the temple in 3D along with other related information.</p>
               <p>In January 2023, two 60 million-year-old Shaligram rocks, 26 tonnes and 14 tonnes respectively, were sent from the Gandaki river in Nepal. These rocks were used to carve the idol of Ram Lalla in the sanctum sanctorum.[81] As of May 2023, according to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, 70% of the groundwork had been completed and 40% of the roof work had been completed.[82] As of December 2023, the entire base, along with the six smaller temples that will surround the main temple, which consists the sanctum sanctorum, are almost completed and is on track to be completed by 22 January 2024.</p>


               <h2 id="consecration">Consecration</h2>
               <p>In preparation for the pran pratishtha (consecration) ceremony, the Government of Uttar Pradesh has earmarked ₹100 crore (US$13 million) for 'Ramotsav,' a series of religious events spanning 826 local bodies across Uttar Pradesh and the Ram Paduka Yatra. Commencing in December 2023, the events will culminate in grand celebrations from Makar Sankranti on 16 January 2024, until the inauguration of the Ram temple on 22 January. The yatra will follow the Ram Van Gaman Path, retracing Ram's 14-year exile from Ayodhya.[84] Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with RSS Sarsanghchalak, Mohan Bhagwat, Manmohan Singh, Mallikarjun Kharge and many other leaders have been invited for the consecration ceremony.[85][86] The guest list also includes India's industrialists, scientists, actors, army officers, spiritual leaders and Padma awardees.</p>

               <h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>
               <p>The temple trust decided to launch a nationwide "mass contact and contribution campaign" aimed at reaching 55-600 million people.[47] Voluntary donations of ₹ 10 and higher were accepted.[89] On 1 January 2021, former President Ram Nath Kovind made the first contribution towards the construction of the Ram Mandir by donating more than ₹ 5 lakh.[90] Several leaders and notable personalities across the nation followed this. By April 2021, around ₹ 5,000 was collected from donations across India.[91][92] Nearly 150,000 VHP activists participated in collecting donations. The temple trust also received donations from the members of the Muslim and Christian communities.</p>
               <p>A few individuals, including former Chief Ministers of Karnataka, H. D. Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah, the current Chief Minister of Karnataka, strongly questioned how the funds were collected.[94][95] After failing to raise the desired amount, the headmistress of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh school experienced bullying, and was subsequently suspended. A similar case occurred in Ballia district.[96][97] Following allegations of corruption, Tata Consultancy Services was brought in to digitise the monetary accounts.</p>


               <h2 id="controversies">Controversies</h2>
               <h3 id="alleged"><b>Alleged donation scam</b></h3>
               <p>In 2015, Hindu Mahasabha, among the leading organisation involved in the Ram Mandir issue, alleged BJP affiliate Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) of carrying out donation scam of over Rs. 1,400 crores over the construction of the temple. VHP has denied this allegation.</p>
               <p>In 2019, Nirmohi Akhara accused VHP of carrying out Rs. 1,400 crore scam over the temple.</p>

               <h3 id="sidelining"><b>Sidelining of the major activists</b></h3>
               <p>In 2017, Hindu Mahasabha criticized BJP, Bajrang Dal and other Sangh Parivar organisations for hijacking the Ram Mandir. National vice president of Hindu Mahasabha, Pandit Ashok Sharma added that his organisation pursued the fight but it was "later hijacked by BJP and its other saffron affiliates".</p>
               <p>In 2020, Pramod Joshi, national spokesperson of Hindu Mahasabha, said that the real credit of Ram Mandir belongs to Hindu Mahasabha but "Hindu Mahasabha has been kept away from the bhoomi pujan of the Ram temple and in reality, we should have performed the bhoomi pujan of the temple". He added that the committee for the temple was formed at the BJP's central office and Hindu Mahasabha was sidelined.</p>
            
               <h3 id="politicisation"><b>Politicisation of the temple</b></h3>
               <p>In 2020, Nirmohi Akhara national spokesperson Mahant Sitaram Das criticised the BJP's decision to lay the foundation of the temple by Narendra Modi and said that the work of the temple should be done only by the religious priests. Das added, "This is a historical temple, not a BJP office.</p>
               <p>A number of opposition parties as well as BJP members have criticised the BJP for politicising the temple and using it for gaining political mileage.[99] Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge had questioned the authority of Home Minister Amit Shah after he declared the opening date of the temple. Kharge asked "Are you the pujari of the Ram Temple. Are you the mahant of the Ram Temple? Let the mahants, sadhus and sants talk about it."[100] BJP leader Subramanian Swamy questioned Modi's involvement in Ram Mandir's inauguration and asked "Modi is instead known for abandoning his wife, and yet he will do the puja?"[101] Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has criticised the Indian media for diverting attention from critical governance issues by overly focusing on the temple.</p>


               <h2 id="in">In popular culture</h2>
               <p>During the 2021 Republic Day parade on Rajpath, Uttar Pradesh's tableau showcased a replica of the Ram Mandir.</p>
               
               <h3 id="slogans"><b>Slogans</b></h3>
               <p>Mandir wahi banayenge (transl. The temple will be built exactly there) is an expression in Hindi, and has become one of the most popular slogans concerning the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and Ram Mandir. It has been used as early as 1985–86, was popularised in the 1990s, and has several variations.</p>
               <p>It has been a symbol of hope and it has become a part of festivities, and has also become a part of stand-up comedy, jokes and memes.[108][verification needed] In 2019, the slogan was used in the Parliament of India,[108] and it has also been used by media houses.[109][110] The slogan has been used as a threat as well as a vow.</p>
               <p>There are variations of the slogan such as one used by Lal Krishna Advani: "Saugandh Ram ki Khat-e hain; Hum Mandir Wahin Banayegein" (transl. We take a vow of Rama that we will build the temple exactly there).[106] Other variations and adaptations include "Wahin Banega Mandir" (transl. A temple will be built there),[109] "Jaha Ram Ka Janma Hua Tha, Hum Mandir Wahi Banayenge" (transl. The temple will be built where Ram was born),[107] "Ram Lalla Hum Aayenge; Mandir Wahi Banayenge" (transl. Ram Lalla, we will come, the temple will be built there or Ram Lalla we will come to construct a Mandir exactly there.)[107] and "Pehle mandir, fir sarkaar" (transl. First the temple, then the government).</p>
